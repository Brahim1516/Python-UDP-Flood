# Python-UDP-Flood
Very basic DOS attack made with python.

It can be converted into a DDOS attack using multiple computers.

I'm not responsible the use you give using this program.

## Usage
download or copy the script of rundos.sh

Maybe you should do to make it work.
```bash
chmod +x rundos.sh
```
